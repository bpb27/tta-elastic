            Trump has not tweeted that he inherited upward economic trends from prior administrations, that economies are relatively unrelated to presidential action, or that the greatest economic crash of all time happened on his watch.

            Trump is averaging 1.5% quarterly growth, and 2.5% quarterly growth pre-Coronavirus. His best quarter came in 2018 with 3.3% growth, and his worst quarter came in 2020 with -9.5% growth (worst in history).

            Pre-Coronavirus, unemployment was at its lowest level since 1954. Trump presided over a 1.5% drop in unemployment, following the 5.3% drop during the Obama years.

            Trump also presided over the highest unemployment rate in history in April 2020 at 14.7%.

          <Paragraph>
            Trump is obviously not on track to get rid of the US government debt. Even before the COVID stimulus, there was no meaningful progress made on debt reduction. Debt has skyrocketed since the Reagan years, with the exception of the Clinton years.

          <Paragraph>
            Trump added $5.7 trillion to the debt in a little more than 3 years. Notably, he tweeted about debt <Link to='/?searchbox=%22debt%22&retweet=%5B%22Hide+Retweets%22%5D'>161 times</Link> during the Obama presidency, but only 16 times during his own presidency. Both administrations faced unprecedented crises (Coronavirus, the Great Recession) that required massive stimulus to stave off economic collapse.

          <Paragraph>
            Trump often claims that electing Democrats would crash the stock market, despite the fact that the Obama/Biden years saw a 140% increase. Trump has presided over accelerated stock market increases (especially in 2017), though there have been a number of erratic and precipitous drops, including the three largest single-day drops in history.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph type="conclusion">
            Trump taking credit for "the greatest economy in history" is a bit like being handed the baton at the last lap of a race with a big lead, only to stumble at the finish line because you thought the hurdles were fake news. The growth was inherited, and if he intends to take credit, he must also own the decline.
